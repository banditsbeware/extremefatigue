    <h3>vocab</h3>

    <p>
      I have made a habit of noticing words or phrases that a) don't make sense and/or b) sound nice and should be remembered for future use. It is difficult to read a text that contains language outside my vocabulary, so I will look up these words and write down the definition. At the end of each month I will collect them and make a post. Here's what I found in July:

    <ul style='list-style-type:none; margin:0; padding:0'>

      <li><b>idiom</b> an expression in usage of a language that is peculiar to itself because a) its meaning cannot be derived from its constituent words ("up in the air") or b) it uses words in a grammatically atypical way ("give way")</li>
      <li><b>continuous symmetry</b> some symmetries can be viewed as motions, as opposed to discrete properties. Discrete symmetries can be reinterpreted as a subset of a higher dimensional continuous symmetry; a reflection of a 2D object in 3D space can be achieved by continuously rotating that object 180 degrees in a non-parallel plane</li>

          <li>"the dude reporting this jawn has not the slightest clue"</li>
        </ul></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      One of my favorite features on Macbooks is force-touching a word to look it up in the dictionary. It's very intuitive and I probably use it at least once for every article/newsletter/wikipedia page I read. It has made it convenient to ensure that I know the definitions of all the words I'm reading and using.
