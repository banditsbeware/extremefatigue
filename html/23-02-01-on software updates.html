    <p><b>A software update which demands too much of the hardware</b></p>

    <p>Software is much easier to develop than hardware</br>will hardware always be behind?</br>Yes, until software reaches <em>theoretically optimal performance</em></p>

    <p>How would you even define that? (T.O.P.)</br>
      ★ algorithms that best utilize <em>infinite compute power?</em></br>
      No, it shouldn't be defined that way, compute will always be</p>
    <p style='font-size:200%; text-align:center'>finite...</p>
    <p>limited by finite matter and ultimately the speed of light.</p>

    <p>★ algorithms that finish as fast as physically possible on the given hardware? but what if the software causes the hardware to break, by overheating and melting? could you <u>always</u> push hardware to failure?</p>

    <p> &gt; or, just modify to say </br>```as fast as possible without harming the hardware```!?</p>

    <p>It could be the case that humans create algorithms which are theoretically (mathematically) demonstrable to be <em>optimal</em>... meaning that there is no better <em>approach</em> to solving a problem, even if we know that, currently, performance is limited by hardware</p>
