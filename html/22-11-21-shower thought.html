    <p>
"I had a thought which one could only have in the shower in the shower" is a thought which one could only have in the shower that I had in the shower this morning, but I can't recall the specific thought thought causing such a reflective shower thought. 
    </p><p>
It is common for me to have the sensation of certainty that at some recent point in the past (at most, the previous day), I had a really useful insight or exciting idea or bizarre dream, but cannot remember its actual content. this is <em>extremely frustrating</em>, like knowing something valuable lies behind a locked door and I only lack the key. These ideas pop up at times when it is difficult to make a note of them, e.g. while in the shower, running, driving.

The brain is for having ideas, not storing them. But in these situations where you can't get a thought crystallized in some external medium, it may help to have a little extra <a target='_blank' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory'>RAM</a> so the idea can survive long enough to make it into the second brain!!
    </p><p>
      My second brain consists of a notebook and a black G2 0.38mm pen (impractical for running and showering). however, there are many options, like Apple Notes, Notion, and other Computer Applications. a bit of consideration has gone into the choice of format, as there are <em>strong pros and cons...</em>

Neither option solves the problem of capturing the <em>best</em> ideas, those that come along when the brain is in its <em>foggiest, most creative</em> state. There is no solution to this besides having better memory and focus so that you can remember later, equipped with a recording medium. the best idea-having states are the least conscientious...
    </p>
    <p>
My approach is just to record as much as possible, even if a thought is incomplete. Being able to go back and get at least a hint of the state of the brain is a powerful tool for making connections.
