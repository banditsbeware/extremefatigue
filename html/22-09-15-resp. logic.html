    <h3>resp. logic</h3>

    <p>From Wikipedia:</p>

    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mathematical_jargon"> 
      <b>resp.</b> (Respectively) A convention to shorten parallel expressions. "A (resp. B) [has some relationship to] X (resp. Y)" means that A [has some relationship to] X and also that B [has (the same) relationship to] Y. For example, squares (resp. triangles) have 4 sides (resp. 3 sides); or compact (resp. Lindel&#246;f) spaces are ones where every open cover has a finite (resp. countable) open subcover.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      In order to construct statements of this form, find two pairs of objects that share the same relationship to one another. This reminds me of an exercise we did in elementary school using the form A:X::B:Y ("A is to X as B is to Y"). A statement would be given with one of the four variables missing, so the relationship had to be inferred from the complete pair and then applied to the incomplete pair. For example: the answer to `Book:Author::_____:Architect` is `Building`. 
    </p>
    <p>Resp. logic changes the order from A:X::B:Y to A/B:X/Y, and the "is to" that the colon represents is made explicit; in this form, the example puzzle is `Books (resp. ______) are created by Authors (resp. Architects). Filling in the variables: Books/Buildings are created by Authors/Architects. At this level, the resp. logic statement is vaguely "close" to the incorrect statement: "Books or Buildings are created by Authors or Architects". Similarly: "Squares or Triangles have 4 or 3 Sides"... "The grass or the sky is green or blue". </p>

    <p><small>The issues with these examples are made obvious in A:X::B:Y form. In A/B:X/Y form, it is easier to get away with multiple definitions and wordplay. It may be best to prohibit linguistic trickery in the creation of these statements, as one may want to ensure that their meanings correspond to literal facts about the world...</small></p>

    <em>The torus (resp. my shirt) has a hole in the middle (resp. its sleeve). </em>
    <p> Sleeve:Shirt::Middle:Torus</p>
    <p><small>The shared relationship of "hole location" confuses a circumstantial (the hole in my shirt <em>happens</em> to be in its sleeve, but it could be elsewhere, or not exist at all) with definitional (a torus is <em>defined</em> with a hole in the middle) situations.</small></p></br>

    <em>The network stack (resp. government) is separated into multiple layers (resp. branches). </em>
    <p>Layers:Network Stack::Branches:Government</p></br>

    <em>I'm using beans from Columbia (resp. Trader Joe's) for my coffee (resp. dinner).</em>
    <p>Columbia:Coffee::Trader Joe's:Dinner</p></br>

    <em>The shop (resp. engineer) is under the apartments (resp. manager). </em>
    <p>Engineer:Manager::Shop:Apartments</p>
    <p><small>Entirely different meanings of "under" are disregarded. The state of "being located underneath" is not, in fact, equivalent to "having a lower ranking than".</small></p></br>

    <em>An acronym (resp. scissors) shortens a phrase (resp. length of string). </em>
    <p>Acronym:Phrase::Scissors:String</p>
    <p><small>The relationship is confused because, while scissors physically separate parts of the string, an acronym <em>represents</em> a phrase in a shorter form. The distinction is that the acronym, once learned, carries the same meaning as the phrase itself.</small></p></br>

    <em>The grass (resp. sky) is green (resp. blue). </em>
    <p>Green:Grass::Blue:Sky</p></br>


    <p>
<b>use of a precise mathematical tool on the fuzzy logic of language</b> &mdash; It is easy to generate examples that seem to work in the logical formula, but they often employ a linguistic trick (some feature of language giving words multiple meanings, or a generally looser interpretation) which does not translate into the rigor of mathematics.
