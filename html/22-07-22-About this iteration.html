    <h3>About this iteration</h3>

    <p>I've tried building my personal website in several ways. The first was Wix. I think I experimented with WordPress at one point. Once I really started programming, I learned Flask and used that for a while. Now, in the spirit of the beautifully simple web1.0 sites I keep discovering, I'm learning PHP and starting over from scratch. Ideally this will allow me to get used to consistently writing instead of tweaking the design.</p>

    <p>I won't be tracking this project in a public git repository (I used to do this religiously) as I found that the satisfaction of seeing a populated contribution heatmap on my profile led to less meaningful contributions. In many commits I was just moving things around and updating styles.</p>

    <p>For the time being, I won't be implementing a database. I enjoyed learning about PHP and SQL in college courses, but I simply don't have enough data to justify taking the time to design the schema. I came up with a basic file naming convention that makes it easy to organize posts by date and show their titles, and that's plenty for now. Eventually, tags and search may be useful.</p>

    <p>I've kept a journal for about five years now (increasingly more like a commonplace book), which has been a great way to keep track of thoughts, notes, plans, etc. This site is like a public journal in that it follows my interests, but the writing should be more refined since it's visible to others.</p>
