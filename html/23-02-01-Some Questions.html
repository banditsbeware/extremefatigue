    <h3>Some Questions</h3>

    <p>National Geographic images make me want to be a scientist. for all the reading/talking <em>about</em> science, I don't <em>do</em> much science</p>
    <p>in the sense of discovering new things about the world</br>I learn things, but that is particular to me. most of what I have learned was discovered by someone else.</p>
    <p>Computer science is the odd one out among the things we call science. it is creating - - unclear if discovering, but I suspect not.</br>Actually I Don't Know</br>but if I'm a computer scientist, I must create in that field... algorithms, theorems, methodologies, structures</p>
    <p> All that is abstract, yet so practical,, paradoxically so, as we use these machines every day. there is so much "science" going on behind the scenes to create/discover the abstract structures that allow humans to better communicate with &amp; manipulate the machine (programming languages &amp; paradigms &amp; databases &amp; compilers...) so</p>
    <p>so maybe a question could begin a scientific endeavor, so</p>
    <ul>
      <li>so is computer science a science or not?</li>
      <li>could I ever contribute to it?</li>
      <li>&amp; is math created or discovered?</li>
      <li>will science ever end?</li>
      <li>what would most fulfill me?</li>
      <li>will people always need in-person interaction?</li>
      <li>will there ever be an unbreakable system?</li>
      <li>what is the role of money?</li>

      <li>will there always be cognitive fallacies?</li>
      <li>will humans ever permanently leave earth?</li>
      <li>what are the consequences of removing selective pressure from humans?</li>

      <li>where should I live?</li>
      <li>where do I want to live?</li>
      <li>should I try to leave a lasting impact/do something "important"?</li>
      <li>am I capable of that?</li>
      <li>is that even definable?</li>
      <li>how can one waste no time?</li>
      <li>how much of what we think we know about history is actually right?</li>
      <li>just how immutable are one's immutable characteristics?</li>
