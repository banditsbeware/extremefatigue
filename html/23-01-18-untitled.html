     waves of happiness and sadness
    it is difficult to begin writing about ______; the beginning of
   writing is to go from nothing to something on the page and while this
  page contains nothing i want to start at everything. everything is 
  what is on my mind, everything, and everything that could be
(and now i know - i know - that `could` is true, that could be)
                                                 what could be? </pre>
    <p style='float: right; font-size: 3em;'>could</p>
    <pre>
it could be perfect, a relationship, she could be here or i could be there, we
   could be anywhere and still fall in love again, it       could be exactly what i need, and that
   could be not-selfish, and she could think of me and that could be a better version of
myself than the one in the mirror
    </pre>

    <pre>
i wish i could be more for her, more smart, funny, stylish, creative, nearby; i wish
       i could be.now.so, i'm inspired to live more, as though
       i could be more than
  what i am
