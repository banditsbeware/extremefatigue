    <h3>palmdale</h3>
    <p>
Palmdale is much lonelier feeling than Fort Worth, though this week has been similar to a normal one back home in many ways. Wake up alone, run, shower, work at the plant for 10 hours, eat dinner, look at computer. That's normal life,, why this melancholy feeling? it could be the lack of all the particular inputs that feel like home: driving my own car, seeing the Fort Worth skyline, making my own coffee, seeing my own decorations in my lonely apartment. maybe its just that all the negativity directed toward this place by others has subconsciously added up and surmounted my taste&nbsp;for&nbsp;it.&nbsp;surmounted?&nbsp;subverted?&nbsp;subdued?&nbsp;soured?&nbsp;subtended?&nbsp;sublimated?&nbsp;short&nbsp;circuited?&nbsp;sacked?&nbsp;subordinated?&nbsp;splintered?&nbsp;shifted?&nbsp;superceded?
