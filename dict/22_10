<li><b>witness </b> (mathematical logic) a specific value \(t\) to be substituted for variable \(x\) in an existential statement of the form \( \exists x \phantom x \psi (x) \) such that \( \psi (x) \) is true. for example: \(t=2\) witnesses \(\exists x : x \gt 1 \)</li>
<li><b>counterfactual definiteness (CFD) </b> (quantum mechanics) the ability to speak "meaningfully" about the results of measurements that have not been performed ("meaningfully" &rarr; the ability to treat unmeasured results on equal footing with measured results in statistical calculations)</li>

<li><b>busy beaver </b>(theoretical computer science) game that aims at finding a terminating program of a given size that produces the most output possible. design a halting turing maching with alphabet {0, 1} which writes the most 1s on the tape, using only a given set of states. the rules for the n-state game: 1) the machine must have n states in addition to the halting state, and 2) the tape initially contains only 0s. an n<sup>th</sup> busy beaver is a turing maching that wins the n-state game: it attains the largest number of 1s among all other possible n-state turing machines</li>
